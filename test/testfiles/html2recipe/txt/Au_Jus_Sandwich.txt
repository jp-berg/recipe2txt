Au Jus Sandwich



360.0 min | 4 servings

3 tablespoons flour
2–3 pounds (0.91–1.4 kg) roast or other cut of beef
1 beef bouillon cube
1 can (~2 cups / 16 oz / 470 ml) beef consommé, bouillon cube equivalent, or additional roast beef
1 can (~2 cups / 16 oz / 470 ml) French onion soup
1 cup (2 sticks / 250 g / 8.8 oz) butter
1 can (16 oz / 470 ml) beer (optional)
Spices (e.g. salt, pepper) (optional)
4 French/sandwich/hoagie rolls



Combine all the ingredients except the rolls in a slow cooker or crock pot. Let the mixture simmer for at least six hours. This step is critical because it makes the meat tender.

Serve beef on split rolls.

You can either pre-dip the sandwich, or serve with a bowl of meat drippings. When serving the drippings separately, remove the beef shreds from the juices and serve with a small bowl of meat drippings on the side. Dip the sandwiches in the drippings as you eat.
